#+DESCRIPTION: Readme for ktkbot.
#+AUTHOR: Mathias Estrup

ktkbot is a bot that sends push notifications when new tennis events are put up for Kl√∏vermarkens Tennis Klub (KTK).

KTK has no automatic notification system for when new events (i.e. training lessons) are made available on the booking website. Joining events requires doing so before the number of available spots fill up. By getting these notifications, you gain the advantage of knowing immediately when events become available.

* Installation
Either download the latest binary release or clone the repository.

** Download Binary (easy)
Download the [[https://github.com/mestru17/ktkbot/releases/latest][latest release]] and place it wherever you want.

** Clone the repository (requires [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html][Cargo]])
Clone the repository and build from source yourself to get the newest version including unreleased changes:
#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mestru17/ktkbot.git
$ cd ktkbot
$ cargo build --release
#+end_src

This compiles ktkbot and puts the executable in the =target/release= directory.

* Usage
Either add the =ktkbot= executable to your =PATH= or simply run it from whichever directory it resides in. Note that you need to supply your Pushover API and group keys as arguments at the moment.

** Run from anywhere (i.e. ktkbot is in =PATH=)
#+begin_src bash
$ ktkbot [OPTIONS] <PUSHOVER API KEY> <PUSHOVER GROUP KEY>
#+end_src

** Run from directory
#+begin_src bash
$ ./path/to/ktkbot [OPTIONS] <PUSHOVER API KEY> <PUSHOVER GROUP KEY>
#+end_src

** Options
By passing the ~--help~ flag, you can also get a more in-depth usage description that includes configuration options:
#+begin_src bash
$ ktkbot --help
ktkbot 0.12.0
